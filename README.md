🖼️ Image Downloader Extension

A lightweight browser extension for Brave/Chrome that makes downloading images effortless.

🚀 Why this project?

Downloading images from websites can be unnecessarily complicated — right-click restrictions, hidden elements, or endless inspecting. This extension solves that by providing a simple one-click solution to detect and download images directly from any webpage.

✨ Features (Planned)

🔍 Detect all images on the current page

📥 Download individual images with one click

📂 “Download All” option for bulk saving

🎚️ Filter images by resolution/size (ignore thumbnails or small icons)

📝 Custom file naming scheme (e.g., page-title_timestamp_index.jpg)

⚡ Minimal, user-friendly popup interface

🛠️ Built using Manifest V3, JavaScript, and the Chrome Extensions API
